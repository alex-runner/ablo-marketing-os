Seed the curated FALLBACK blocks for the funnel, lifecycle, channels and
command-center sections into content.json.

These are real snapshots captured 2026-06-03 from PostHog (product funnel)
and Klaviyo (lifecycle). build.py overlays LIVE data on top of `funnelCurated`
and `lifecycleCurated` on every refresh; `channels` and `commandCenter` are
the analyst/agent-written surfaces and stay curated until the daily routine
rewrites them.

Re-runnable: splices the four keys into content.json after `battlecard`,
